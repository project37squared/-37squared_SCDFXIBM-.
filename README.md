# -37squared_SCDFXIBM-.
This is Jolyn and Rahim from group 37squared. This is our submission for SCDFXIBM call for code 2020 challenge. 
(a) We chose to tackle the “Preventing The Spread” problem statement which seeks upstream solutions, using technology, to provide efficient responses & strategies to minimize escalation of these incidents into large events. Our team focused on solutions for fire incidents. Information provided by the callers is extremely important for the deployment of adequate resources. Acquisition of information can be further optimized to ensure resources and manpower are allocated efficiently. On that note, we have proposed a solution that incorporates the visual input obtained from drones and with the use of machine learning, convert the visual input into useful data which is critical to determining the resources that the emergency require.
(b)
(c)Architecture of the solution:
Watson speech to text conversion publishes information, or through manual entering of information in the ipynb file, produces a dataframe. The dataframe will be disseminated to deployed firefighters to understand the information better. 995 drones will be deployed immediately to the location where the fire is reported. The attached video camera on the drone will provide critical visual information to deployed officers on the size of the fire and to look for possible entry routes prior to arrival. The pictures and videos taken will be uploaded to IBM cloud storage to strategize entry routes and access points using machine learning. The site plans and details of the location that could affect the spread of the fire will be obtained. Uisng these information, machine learning data will be integrated into a site plan which will be used by firefighters to strategize access points to tackle the emergency.

(f) 1. Upload the json file obtained from the repository into node-red to see the flow sequence proposed for the project
    2. Download the object detection model from the repository, named model-mglbszqr.zip. 
    3. Using cacli.exe, run and train the object detection model.
    4. Project37 zip file contains all the images used to train the model.
